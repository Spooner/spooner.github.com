    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt; in order to generate a bit more interesting site.
Previously, I just had a single, hand-generated page, which was fine as a list of links really, but it wasn’t useful as a showcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt; seems to be pretty good overall and I think it was a better choice for me than Jekyll, which I’d used previously.
It isn’t too complicated and manages HAML for layout, kramdown for content and SASS for style quite nicely.
One thing that dismays me a little is that you have to manually manage rules for compilation and routing, when it could have much more reasonable defaults set up and a bit more assumption of standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;

100.times do |x|
