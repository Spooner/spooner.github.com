### Changelog

  * All releases now include source code.
  * Added Windows INSTALLER.
  * Stopped spitting out more than one hoop at once, since there is a good chance that the keyboard can't read two keys at once.
  * Added menu on game-over, so you can go replay the same game or go back to menu or quit.
  * Added one-player mode to allow player to control either dancer (previously only 2-player mode was available).
  * Reduced font size so that it is easier to use the GUI.
  * Removed beeps when you play correctly (still get buzz when you fail).
  * Fixed occasional graphical glitches.
  * OSX package now runs on OS X 10.5 or later.
  * Linux version now works with Ruby 1.9.3
