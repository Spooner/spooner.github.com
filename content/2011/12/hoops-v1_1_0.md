### Changelog

  * Added two new tracks from KanonBaum (Brian Peppers).
  * Can now choose length of game (30s, 60s, 90s, etc), rather than being limited to the track length.
  * Read track length from .ogg file (yeah, asking the user to enter it manually was dumb!).
  * Prevented user from adding multiple copies of the same track to their tracklist.
