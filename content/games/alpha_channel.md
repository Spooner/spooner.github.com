As the last of the Blue Pixels, take direct control of your enemies in order to destroy them before they obliterate you. Prevail against the hordes of malignant Red Pixels and 5 differently coloured boss Pixels so that you can return to your endless musing on the nature of the Great Electron Gun!


The [original version] was created in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare #18], but was relatively basic. The competition theme was "Enemies as Weapons", which became the central mechanic of the game.

An extended version was created after the competition (adding boss fights and improved physics and visuals).
