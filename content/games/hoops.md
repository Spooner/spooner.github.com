Play as Meow and/or Star, two dancers who do nothing better than strutting their stuff on the dance-floor and try to outdo each other. Build up an impressive score multiplier by synchronising your buttons with the rolling hula-hoops and especially those hoops ridden by cats, who will dance with you if you impress them!

Choose from 4 dance tracks while playing, two of which were composed especially for the game or add your own tracks to be played in the game (.ogg files only). The game has 4 difficulty levels and when playing in 2-player mode, players may play on different difficulty levels, so you can more easily play with kids or with your nan, while still having a fun game.
