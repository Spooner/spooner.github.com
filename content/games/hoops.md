Play as Meow and/or Star, two dancers who do nothing better than strutting their stuff on the dance-floor and try to outdo each other. Build up an impressive score multiplier by synchronising your buttons with the rolling hoola-hoops and especially those hoops ridden by cats, who will dance with you if you impress them!

Choose from 4 dance tracks while playing, two of which were composed especially for the game. Users can add their own tracks to be played in the game (.ogg files only). The game has 4 difficulty levels and when playing in 2-player mode, players may play on different difficulty levels, so you can more easily play with kids or with your nan, while still having a fun game.
