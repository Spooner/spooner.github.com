A game of sacrifice and wearing a chicken on your head (2 players, locally or networked).

Full title: 'Wrath: Appease or Die!'

The game is played on a number of maps (which are semi-randomly generated), such as the desert island, where the priests have to keep the volcano god from getting angry:

Or deep under the sea, where the probing tentacles of the Kraken threaten to crush the priests:
