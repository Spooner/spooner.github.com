         ["wrath-22-volcano-island", "Desert island level", "The desert island, where the priests have to keep the volcano god from getting angry"],
         ["wrath-29-better_craters", "Yuggoth level", "In space, no-one can hear you wear a chicken on your head"],
         ["wrath-30-the_kraken", "Undersea level", "Deep under the sea, where the probing tentacles of the Kraken threaten to crush the priests"]
