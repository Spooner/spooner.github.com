The full title of the game is, 'Wrath: Appease or Die!'.

The game is played on a number of maps (which are semi-randomly generated), such as the desert island, where the priests have to keep the volcano god from getting angry:

Or deep under the sea, where the probing tentacles of the Kraken threaten to crush the priests:
