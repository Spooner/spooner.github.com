### Changelog

* Stopped lasers from moving, since they forced the player to stop and destroyed the flow of the game. Now you can jump over low beams and walk under high beams.
* Added glue on the floor (prevents jumping).
* Added hyper-speed pill (increases run-speed, but forces you to run as fast as you can).
* Hover-board now imposes a minimum speed.
* Added venus fly traps.
* Added 5th level (The Garden).
* More clearly showed keyboard shortcuts for buttons by highlighting the key required (shortcuts have always been there, but most people didn't think of using them).
* Added tool-tips.
* Reduced speed of the really fast camera panning when you die.
* Merged high-scores for each level (get bonus for inversion/hardcore, rather than storing separate scores).
* Added online high scores for each level.
* Fixed: Player can move at a different speed to the animation of the conveyor it is moving on.
* Fixed: Time remaining added to score after death in Hardcore mode.
* Fixed: Time remaining added at much to great a rate after completion of a course.
