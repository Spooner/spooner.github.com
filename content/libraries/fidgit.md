A GUI toolkit built on [Gosu]/[Chingu].

It uses a system of hierarchical packing containers to hold relatively advanced controls, such as scrolling windows with scroll-bars. It also has editable text areas which handle clipboard (copy/paste/delete) actions.

Fidgit requires Ruby 1.9.2 or higher and will only work when coupled with [Gosu] and [Chingu]. It is cross-platform and should work on any type of PC (Windows, Linux, OS X). To install:

    > gem install fidgit

Fidgit is used to build a nice user interface in several of my games, [Hoops](/games/hoops), [Sidney](/games/sidney), [Smash and Grab](/games/smash_and_grab) and [Wrath](/games/wrath).
