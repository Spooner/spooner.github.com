Fidgit is a GUI toolkit built on [Gosu]/[Chingu] for Ruby. It uses a system of hierarchical packing containers to hold relatively advanced controls, such as scrolling windows and file dialogs.

Features
--------

* Advanced controls, such as scrolling windows with automatic scroll-bars.
* TextArea which handles multi-line input also is compatible with the system clipboard (cut/copy/paste).


Installation
------------

Fidgit requires Ruby 1.9.2 or higher and will only work when coupled with the [Gosu] and [Chingu] gems. It is cross-platform and should work on any type of PC (Windows, Linux, OS X). To install:

    > gem install fidgit

Example usage
-------------

Fidgit is used to build a nice user interface in several of my games: [Hoops](/games/hoops), [Sidney](/games/sidney), [Smash and Grab](/games/smash_and_grab) and [Wrath](/games/wrath).
