A flip-book editing/viewing tool for [Sleep Is Death](http://sleepisdeath.net)

[Downloads](releases/)

<%= render "project_links" %>

Key usage
---------

* Merging of flip-books, when a game has been stopped and started, due to an intentional or accidental disconnection.
* Removal of dead frames generated while 'pausing' the game (e.g. taking a quick loo break while leaving the game running).
* Viewing flip-books in continual slide-show mode.

Features
--------

### Viewing

* View individual frames, with thumbnails for easy navigation.

* Start/previous/next/end navigation.

* Play/pause flip-books.

### Editing

* Merge existing flip-books (makes playing games with breaks/pauses a lot more manageable, believe me!).

* Delete frames (individual, by range or all identical).

* Save edited flip-book in format identical to that created by the game. This also allows the re-creation of flip-books with new formats, by altering your templates folder.
